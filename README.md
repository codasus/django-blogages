Django Blogages
================

The django-blogages is an ultra-simple blogging tool made using Django 1.3 (django-nonrel).

It provides some basic features:

* Markdown for writing
* Text preview
* Custom themes
* User comments

_For now it only runs on Google App Engine platform._

Example
-------

Take a look at [blogages.appspot.com](http://blogages.appspot.com) for a demonstration.

The administration is not available on demo right now.

TODO
----

* Make it work out of Google App Engine too
* Better way for patching userena to work in Google App Engine
* Use git submodules for external libraries
